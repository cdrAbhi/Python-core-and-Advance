In Python, constructors are special methods called when an object is instantiated. The constructor method is named `__init__`. 

### Default Constructor

A default constructor is one that does not take any arguments (other than `self`). It initializes the object with default values.

**Example:**

```python
class DefaultConstructor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0  # Default value

    def display(self):
        print(f"The value is: {self.value}")

# Creating an object of the DefaultConstructor class
obj = DefaultConstructor()
obj.display()  # Output: The value is: 0
```

### Parameterized Constructor

A parameterized constructor is one that takes arguments in addition to `self`. These arguments are used to initialize the object with specific values.

**Example:**
In Python, destructors are special methods that are called when an object is about to be destroyed. The destructor method in Python is named `__del__`. However, unlike constructors, destructors are less commonly used, as Python's garbage collector handles most of the cleanup automatically.

### Types of Destructors

1. **Default Destructor**
2. **Custom Destructor**

### Default Destructor

Python provides a default destructor that is automatically called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted using the `del` keyword. The default destructor does not require any explicit definition.

**Example:**

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        print(f"Object created with value: {self.value}")

    def __del__(self):
        print(f"Object with value {self.value} is being destroyed")

# Creating an object
obj = MyClass(10)
# Deleting the object explicitly
del obj
```

**Output:**
```
Object created with value: 10
Object with value 10 is being destroyed
```

In this example, the `__del__` method is called automatically when the object `obj` is deleted using the `del` keyword.

### Custom Destructor

A custom destructor is explicitly defined by overriding the `__del__` method. This allows you to include custom cleanup code that should be executed when an object is destroyed.

**Example:**

```python
class FileHandler:
    def __init__(self, file_name):
        self.file_name = file_name
        self.file = open(file_name, 'w')
        print(f"File {self.file_name} opened")

    def write_data(self, data):
        self.file.write(data)

    def __del__(self):
        self.file.close()
        print(f"File {self.file_name} closed")

# Creating an object and writing data to the file
file_handler = FileHandler("example.txt")
file_handler.write_data("Hello, World!")
# Deleting the object explicitly
del file_handler
```

**Output:**
```
File example.txt opened
File example.txt closed
```

In this example:
- The `FileHandler` class opens a file when an object is created and writes data to it.
- The custom destructor (`__del__` method) ensures that the file is properly closed when the object is destroyed.

### Notes on Destructors in Python

- Destructors are not guaranteed to be called immediately when an object goes out of scope. The timing of destructor calls depends on Python's garbage collector.
- If an object has circular references, the `__del__` method might not be called because the garbage collector cannot determine the order in which to destroy the objects.
- Explicitly calling `del obj` decreases the reference count of the object by one. If the reference count becomes zero, the object is destroyed, and the destructor is called.

### Summary

- **Default Destructor:** Automatically provided by Python, requires no explicit definition.
- **Custom Destructor:** Defined by overriding the `__del__` method to include custom cleanup code.
```python
class ParameterizedConstructor:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value  # Value passed during object creation

    def display(self):
        print(f"The value is: {self.value}")

# Creating an object of the ParameterizedConstructor class with a specific value
obj = ParameterizedConstructor(10)
obj.display()  # Output: The value is: 10
```

### Comparison

- **Default Constructor:**
  - No additional arguments.
  - Initializes objects with default values.
  
- **Parameterized Constructor:**
  - Takes additional arguments.
  - Initializes objects with specific values provided during object creation.

### Example with Both Constructors

Here is an example where a class can handle both default and parameterized constructors:

```python
class MixedConstructor:
    def __init__(self, value=0):  # Default value is 0 if no argument is passed
        self.value = value

    def display(self):
        print(f"The value is: {self.value}")

# Creating an object using the default constructor
default_obj = MixedConstructor()
default_obj.display()  # Output: The value is: 0

# Creating an object using the parameterized constructor
param_obj = MixedConstructor(20)
param_obj.display()  # Output: The value is: 20
```

In this example:
- `default_obj` uses the default value of 0 because no argument is provided.
- `param_obj` uses the value 20 because it is provided during object creation.

This approach allows you to create flexible constructors that can work with or without arguments.

Overall when program execution process completed then GC deallocate memory space or delete object.
