				Types of Inheritances OR Re-Usable Techniques
			===============================================
=>Type of Inheritance is one of the Diagram OR Pattern Or Model, which makes us Understand How the features are Inherited from Base Class into Derived Class.
=>In Python Programming, we have 5 Types of Inheritances. They are

			1. Single Inheritance
			2. Multi Level Inheritance
			3. Hierarchical Inheritance
			4. Multiple Inheritance
			5. Hybrid Inheritance

what are difference btwn reusability by module,pakages of function  and inheritance reusability?
=====================================================================
module,pakages reusability : whenever we use function through modul and pakages when we import they take memory space at once.
------------------------------------- 
inheritance reusability : whenever we inherit method to one class to another class they won't take any memory space such type of method so inheritanc based application -----------------------------   are light based application




what are the difference between funtion and module?
=================================================================
Key Points
========
Module Object:
-------------------
   • Role: Serves as a container for functions, classes, and variables,
   • Memory Usage: Generally smaller because it only stores references and metadata (e.g.,module name, file path).

Function Code and Other Elements:
-----------------------------------------------
    • Role: Contains the actual implementation of functions, classes, and data.
    • Memory Usage: Can be larger, depending on the complexity and size of the code.
